# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates


CloudFormation
Cfripper  -> https://github.com/Skyscanner/cfripper
Cloudsploit -> https://cloudsploit.com/opensource
cfn-lint -> https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint

Terraform: 

Chef inspec -> https://github.com/inspec/inspec
Open policy agent / Regula -> https://github.com/fugue/regula
Terrascan -> https://github.com/accurics/terrascan

### Example vulnerability

IAM Policy described in CloudFormation template was sesribed with wildcard actions "*". You should implement as least priviledges as possible.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Container image scanning tools:

Clair
Anchore

### Example vulnerability

If OS packages aren't updated regularly in docker image, there can be found a lot of vulnerabilities inside container image. Reason is hackers find a lot of new vulnerabilites in packages everyday.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

AWS Inspector
AWS SecurityHub
AWS Config

### Example vulnerability

Instance i-02aaecfad60f3eb24 is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
